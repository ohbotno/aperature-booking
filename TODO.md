- **Statistics & Analytics**: 25% complete (2/8 features)
- **Maintenance Management**: 38% complete (3/8 features)
- **Calendar Integration**: 25% complete (2/8 features)

### 🎯 Priority Recommendations
1. **Complete Calendar Interface** - Missing timezone support and calendar sharing
2. **Enhance Notification System** - Email infrastructure exists but needs SMS/push notifications
3. **Implement Advanced Analytics** - Trend analysis and predictive features
4. **Add Missing Booking Features** - Waiting lists, check-in/out, dependencies
5. **Add Performance Optimization** - Caching, query optimization, and monitoring

### 🚨 Critical Missing Areas for Production
- **Testing**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Comprehensive test suite with 56 tests (52 passing, 4 skipped)
- **Performance**: No caching, optimization, or monitoring
- **Deployment**: No CI/CD, Docker, or automation infrastructure
- **Documentation**: Limited API documentation and deployment guides
